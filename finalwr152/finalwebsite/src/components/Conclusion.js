                While ChatGPT certainly has a long way to go in terms of being a severe threat to higher education,
                it suffices to say that this fast progressing technology could potentially lead to an increase in academic dishonesty.
                After looking at all of the data, I found that the majority of students believed that ChatGPT is not only safer for cheaters, but also more accurate than previous technologies. 
                Mainly, students felt that <u>this technology delivers more comfort to cheaters,</u> who know that the source of a unique answer is harder to trace. A few differing perspectives however,
                present the consequence of ChatGPT when used for subjects like humanities, or when posed a hyper-specific question.
                I'll add, that when I posed my own questions to ChatGPT, I found it to <u>give astoundingly "rough" estimations</u> for some complex problems.
                For example, I recently asked it "how many Elephants do you think are born each year?", to which it gave an answer higher than the number of Elephants born each year. Unfortunately for GPT,
                this contradicted numerous sources which described a diminishing Elephant population. Anyways... it's not a perfect technology, and its still far from being infallible.
                My hope is that future quantitative research can focus on the question at hand: <u>do chatbots increase the number of cheaters in higher education?</u>
